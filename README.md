# python_challenge
This repo contains to homework challenges.  One for PyBank and one for PyPoll. 
Both PyBank and PyPoll require various calculations and then a summary output
which is to be written to terminal as well as to a text file.  Thus both 
PyBanks and PyPoll have a main.py for the python code and an text file that
contains the summary.
